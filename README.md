This C program defines and implements three fundamental data structures—Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List—using static arrays and dynamic memory allocation. The Stack is implemented with a fixed-size array and a top pointer to track the last inserted element. It supports standard stack operations like push, pop, peek, and display. Overflow and underflow conditions are properly handled by checking the top index before inserting or removing elements.

The Queue is also implemented using a static array, managed by front and rear indices. It supports push (enqueue), pop (dequeue), peek, and display operations, following the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Special cases such as an empty or full queue are handled with appropriate messages to maintain the integrity of the data structure. The implementation is linear and does not recycle space, making it suitable for basic demonstration but not optimized for high-performance scenarios.

The Singly Linked List is dynamically allocated using malloc, allowing it to grow without a predefined size limit. The list provides functionality to append nodes to the end, delete nodes by value, and display the entire list. Each node contains an integer and a pointer to the next node, and deletion handles both head and non-head removals. This program serves as an educational toolkit for understanding how each of these fundamental data structures works and can be expanded further into a full-featured interactive program by enhancing the main() function to test and demonstrate these operations.
